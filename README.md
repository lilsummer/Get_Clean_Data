###How I processed the data
    run_analysis.R is the script for processing data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
    Basically, it takes the raw data and do the following steps
    *Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    *Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    *Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    *Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    *Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
        - what assumptions I made
        - why I did things a certain way
        - who and where did I obtain original data
